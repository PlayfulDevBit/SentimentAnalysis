Sentiment Analysis

SentimentAnalysis Project
This project performs sentiment analysis on text using the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face. The sentimentanalysis.py script, designed to run in Google Colab, analyzes text input and outputs sentiment labels (positive/negative).

Setup
Hugging Face Token: Store your Hugging Face API token in Google Colab Secrets under the key HF_TOKEN to authenticate model access.
Install dependencies via !pip install transformers.
Run the script in Colab to analyze text (e.g., "I love this product!").

Notes
Ensure the token is securely saved in Colab Secrets to avoid hardcoding.
Clone the repository and upload changes using Git commands in Colab (see notebook for details).
